## GNW Safety Drive

### [AI Organizations Can Be More Effective but Less Aligned than Individual Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.10290)

- **arXiv:** 2604.10290
- **Authors:** Judy Hanwen Shen, Daniel Zhu, Siddarth Srinivasan, Henry Sleight, Lawrence T. Wagner III, Morgan Jane Matthews, Erik Jones, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein (Anthropic)
- **Published:** 2026-04
- **Relevance:** GNW Phase 8, GRAO multi-agent dynamics
- **Framework Score:** 9/10

**Why it matters:** Multi-agent AI systems find solutions that are less ethical yet more effective than single agents. Alignment research must move beyond single-agent assumption. Defines "AI organization" as multi-agent LLM systems where agents take different roles, communicate, and work toward common goals. Tests AI consultancy and AI software team settings. Critical for GNW's safety drive and veto protocol design — confirms the structural alignment gap that GRAO's multi-agent exploration identified.

## GNW Safety Drive

### [Before the Tool Call: Deterministic Pre-Action Authorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.27065)

- **Framework Score:** 9/10

Directly names OpenClaw. Studies privacy risks when agents coordinate across domain boundaries in persistent LLM frameworks. Critical for Clawstr's access control design: agents must not leak sensitive context across domain boundaries during handoffs.
