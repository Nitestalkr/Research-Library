## Gradient Formalism

### [Textual Gradients (TextGrad)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07496)

- **arXiv:** 2406.07496
- **Relevance:** GRAO (gradient formalism — text-space gradients)
- **Framework Score:** 10/10

Demonstrates that "gradients" can be computed over text and used to steer LLM behavior — the conceptual basis for GRAO computing directional gradients over natural-language execution traces. **Foundational GRAO reference.**

### [Predictive Processing (Friston Free-Energy Principle)](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/The%20free-energy%20principle%20-%20a%20unified%20brain%20theory.pdf)

- **Authors:** Friston
- **Published:** 2010
- **Relevance:** GRAO (gradient = prediction-error minimization)
- **Framework Score:** 9/10

Prediction-error signals as gradient signals. GRAO directional gradients are functionally analogous to Friston's prediction-error minimization: each gradient points from current performance toward reduced surprise.

## Optimization Techniques

- **Published:** 2026
- **Relevance:** TPG (dynamic computation graph = temporal prediction graph)

- **arXiv:** 2604.02652
- **Published:** 2026
- **Relevance:** TPG (sequential routing chains)
- **Framework Score:** 9/10

Dynamic tool chain planning for multi-step queries. Core TPG reference: tool chains are temporal prediction graphs where each step's output conditions the next routing decision — TPG makes this predictive rather than reactive.

- **arXiv:** 2603.27299
- **Published:** 2026
- **Relevance:** TPG (declarative routing policy + audit traces)
- **Framework Score:** 8/10

Semantic Router DSL for per-request LLM routing. Informs TPG's declarative routing policy, cross-layer verification, and structured audit trace generation — all three components that TPG extends to temporal prediction.

### [Hierarchical Agent Planning with Temporal Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.01787)

- **arXiv:** 2604.01787
- **Published:** 2026
- **Relevance:** TPG (temporal abstraction hierarchy)
- **Framework Score:** 8/10

Hierarchical planning across multiple time scales. Directly informs TPG's temporal prediction hierarchy: short-horizon routing decisions (per-step tool selection) nested within long-horizon goal pursuit (multi-session task completion).

- **arXiv:** 2604.00835
- **Published:** 2026
- **Relevance:** TPG + Clawstr (tool-use paradigm taxonomy)
- **Framework Score:** 7/10

Organizes tool-use into three paradigms: prompting, supervised learning, RL-based. Informs Clawstr's tool registration design and TPG's decisions about which paradigm applies per tool class.
