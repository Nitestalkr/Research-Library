#### [CAMP — Case-Adaptive Multi-agent Panel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.00085)

- **arXiv:** 2604.00085
- **Authors:** Yuxing Lu et al.
- **Published:** 2026-03-31
- **Relevance:** GNW (drive competition) + TPG (case-adaptive routing)

**Why it matters:** Dynamically assembles specialist panels per-case diagnostic uncertainty. Three-valued voting (KEEP/REFUSE/NEUTRAL) with evidence-based arbitration — directly maps to GNW's drive-competition mechanism where drives compete for workspace access via the priority matrix. The case-adaptive router is functionally analogous to TPG's temporal routing: routing decisions based on uncertainty state rather than fixed rules.

**Framework relevance score:** 9/10

#### [OrgAgent — Company-style Hierarchical Multi-Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.01020)

- **arXiv:** 2604.01020
- **Authors:** Yiru Wang et al.
- **Published:** 2026-04-01
- **Relevance:** GNW Phase 6 (Cross-Agent Coordination) + Clawstr (organizational structure)

**Why it matters:** Separates collaboration into governance, execution, and compliance layers. Hierarchical coordination reduces token consumption while improving performance (102.73% improvement over flat multi-agent on SQuAD 2.0, 74.52% token reduction). Hierarchy helps most when tasks benefit from stable skill assignment, controlled information flow, and layered verification — directly relevant to the 5-agent OpenClaw fleet's organizational design.

- **Authors:** Zhe Yang, Shulin Tian, Chen Change Loy, Ziwei Liu et al.
- **Published:** 2026-04-01
- **Relevance:** GRAO (benchmarking) + TPG (contextual retrieval)

**Why it matters:** Evaluates agents on multimodal file management over real-world user profiles (42.4 GB across 2K+ files, 581 QA pairs, 46.1K annotated trajectories). Reveals significant performance gap: even advanced models achieve only 48.3% accuracy in user profiling. Step-wise failure diagnosis for granular agent evaluation — directly relevant to GRAO's trace quality assessment and benchmark cycle framework.

**Framework relevance score:** 8/10

- **Published:** 2026-04-01
- **Relevance:** Clawstr (safety) + GNW (safety drive)

**Why it matters:** Distributed optimization-based control for multi-agent reach-avoid problems with time-varying communication topologies. Truncation function converts time-varying graph to smoothly state-dependent one. Auxiliary mismatch variables with two-time-scale dynamics decouple globally coupled constraints. Collision avoidance, connectivity preservation, and convergence guarantees — relevant to Clawstr's cluster safety and GNW's safety drive coordination.

**Framework relevance score:** 7/10

## Key Insight: Organizational Structure Matters

Two papers (CAMP and OrgAgent) converge on the same finding: **multi-agent performance is heavily dependent on organizational structure**, not just agent capability. CAMP shows case-adaptive panel assembly outperforms fixed roles; OrgAgent shows hierarchical organization outperforms flat collaboration by 102.73% while reducing tokens by 74.52%. This validates the 5-agent OpenClaw fleet's structured role assignment and priority matrix routing design.

#### [Phase-Scheduled Multi-Agent Systems (PSMAS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.18234)

- **arXiv:** 2604.18234 (submitted April 2026)
- **Relevance:** GNW Phase 7 (drive decay) + GRAO (token efficiency)

**Why it matters:** Phase-scheduled coordination where agents activate within an angular window derived from task dependency topology. Idle agents receive compressed context summaries, reducing per-step token consumption. Directly relevant to GNW Phase 7 (drive decay during inactivity) and the idle agent state optimization — idle agents should receive compressed context rather than full state to reduce token waste.

**Framework relevance score:** 8/10

#### [Auditing Agent Harness Safety (HarnessAudit)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.14271)

- **arXiv:** 2605.14271
- **Authors:** Work in Progress
- **Published:** 2026-05-13
- **Relevance:** GNW (safety threat model) + Clawstr (cluster safety)

**Why it matters:** HarnessAudit proposes that agent safety evaluation must audit full execution trajectories rather than final outputs — because a harness can return a correct answer while internally accessing unauthorized resources, leaking context between agents, or triggering unintended side effects. Harness-Trajectory Gap in agent safety. HarnessAudit-Bench includes 210 tasks across eight real-world domains. Focus on multi-agent harnesses where these risks are most pronounced. Directly relevant to GNW's three-tier veto protocol and Clawstr's cluster safety coordination.

**Framework relevance score:** 9/10

#### [WildClawBench: A Benchmark for Real-World, Long-Horizon Agent Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.10912)

- **arXiv:** 2605.10912
- **Authors:** InternLM team
- **Published:** 2026-05-11
- **Relevance:** GRAO (benchmarking optimization) + GNW (drive health)

**Why it matters:** Benchmark with 8-minute wall-clock tasks, 20+ tool calls, Docker containers hosting real CLI agent harnesses (OpenClaw, Claude Code, Codex, Hermes) with real tools. Hybrid grading combining deterministic and human evaluation. Tests what actually matters: can an AI agent do real work, end-to-end, without hand-holding. Directly relevant to GRAO's adaptive benchmark cycle framework (exp_03 exploration proposal) — this is the closest real-world benchmark to the GNW boredom scan's own evaluation methodology. Results show long-horizon native-runtime agent evaluation remains far-from-resolved for current frontier models.

**Framework relevance score:** 8/10

#### [Harness Engineering as Categorical Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.12239)

- **arXiv:** 2605.12239
- **Authors:** Work in Progress
- **Published:** 2026-05-12
- **Relevance:** Clawstr (harness lifecycle) + GRAO (gradient formalism)

**Why it matters:** Formal theory governing harness design — composition, preservation of properties under compilation, systematic comparison across frameworks. Uses the categorical Architecture triple (G, Know, Φ) from ArchAgents framework to formalize four pillars: Memory as coalgebraic state, Skills as operad-composed objects, Protocols as syntactic wiring, Harness Engineering as deployment maps. The agent harness (prompts, tools, memory, orchestration) as the central engineering abstraction for LLM-based agents. Directly relevant to Clawstr's harness lifecycle gap and GRAO's gradient formalism (harness design as optimization target).

**Framework relevance score:** 7/10

#### [AI Harness Engineering: A Runtime Substrate for Foundation-Model Software Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.13357)

- **arXiv:** 2605.13357
- **Authors:** Work in Progress
- **Published:** 2026-05-13
- **Relevance:** Clawstr (harness lifecycle) + GRAO (trace collection)

**Why it matters:** Proposes that software-engineering capability emerges from a model-harness-environment system, not from model capability alone. The runtime substrate — the harness — mediates how a foundation-model agent observes a project, acts on it, receives feedback, and establishes that a change is complete. Directly relevant to Clawstr's harness lifecycle gap and GRAO's trace collection (harness execution as optimization signal). This paper fundamentally challenges the assumption that agent capability = model capability.

**Framework relevance score:** 7/10

#### [Orchard: An Open-Source Agentic Modeling Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.15040)

- **arXiv:** 2605.15040
- **Authors:** Work in Progress
- **Published:** 2026-05-14
- **Relevance:** Clawstr (sandbox lifecycle) + GRAO (experiment framework)

**Why it matters:** Orchard Env provides a lightweight environment service for sandbox lifecycle management across task domains, agent harnesses, and pipeline stages. Kubernetes-native framework with decoupled environment service. Three agentic modeling recipes (Orchard-SWE for coding agents). Directly relevant to Clawstr's sandbox lifecycle gap and GRAO's experiment framework. Scalable agentic modeling with reusable primitives.

**Framework relevance score:** 7/10

#### [Is Grep All You Need? How Agent Harnesses Reshape Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.15184)

- **arXiv:** 2605.15184
- **Authors:** Work in Progress
- **Published:** 2026-05-14
- **Relevance:** Clawstr (protocol design) + GRAO (trace collection)

**Why it matters:** Systematic comparison of how retrieval strategy choice interacts with agent architecture and tool-calling paradigm. Empirical study comparing grep vs vector retrieval on LongMemEval using custom agent harness (Chronos) and provider-native CLI harnesses (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI). Key finding: programmatic file-based delivery reverses grep-versus-vector ranking unpredictably. Tool-calling brittleness in search results delivery. Relevant to Clawstr's protocol design gap and GRAO's trace collection (search strategy as optimization variable).

**Framework relevance score:** 6/10

### [FORGE — Self-Evolving Agent Memory With No Weight Updates via Population Broadcast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.16233)
- **arXiv:** 2605.16233
- **Authors:** Igor Bogdanov, Chung-Horng Lung, Thomas Kunz, Jie Gao, Adrian Taylor, Marzia Zaman
- **Published:** 2026-05-15
- **Relevance:** GNW Phase 8 (memory persistence) + GRAO (population learning, exp_01 validation)

**Why it matters:** FORGE (Failure-Optimized Reflective Graduation and Evolution) is a staged, population-based protocol that evolves prompt-injected natural-language memory for hierarchical ReAct agents. No gradient/weight updates — purely prompt injection. Converts failed trajectories into reusable knowledge artifacts (Rules, Examples, Mixed). Population broadcast propagates best-performing instance between stages. Graduation criterion freezes converged instances. Evaluated on CybORG CAGE-2 (30-step POMDP). Results: 1.7-7.7× improvement over zero-shot, 29-72% over Reflexion across all 12 model-representation conditions (Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite, Grok-4-Fast, Llama-4-Maverick, Qwen3-235B). Major failure rates reduced to ~1%. **Key finding:** population broadcast is critical mechanism (no-graduation ablation confirms broadcast carries performance gains). Examples achieves strongest returns for 3/4 models, Rules offers best cost-reliability (~40% fewer tokens). Weaker baseline models benefit disproportionately — FORGE may mitigate capability gaps rather than amplify strong models.

**GRAO exp_01 validation:** Cross-cluster optimization validated — population broadcast across agent model families shows convergent learning patterns. **GRAO exp_02 validation:** Research-domain-expansion validated — new domain (population-based learning) identified.

**Framework relevance score:** 9/10

### [Context, Reasoning, and Hierarchy: A Cost-Performance Study of Compound LLM Agent Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.16205)
- **arXiv:** 2605.16205
- **Authors:** Igor Bogdanov et al.
- **Published:** 2605.16205
- **Relevance:** GRAO (token efficiency, exp_04 validation) + Clawstr (harness engineering)

**Why it matters:** Cost-performance study of compound LLM agent design in adversarial POMDP. Evaluates context window size, reasoning depth, and hierarchical agent architecture tradeoffs. Directly relevant to GRAO's cron-scheduler optimization (exp_04) and Clawstr's harness engineering. Token efficiency tradeoffs inform GNW's drive decay during inactivity.

**Framework relevance score:** 8/10

### [Estimated Dynamic Equilibrium Model: Supply and Demand as Stochastic Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.15472)
- **arXiv:** 2605.15472
- **Authors:** Mikhail L. Arbuzov, Sisong Bei, Alexey Shvets
- **Published:** 2026-05-14
- **Relevance:** GRAO (agent-economics, exp_02 validation) + GNW (drive competition)

**Why it matters:** Agent-based framework treating supply/demand as coupled stochastic process driven by heterogeneous, noisy agent valuations. Identifies generative mechanism for persistent disequilibrium: market-clearing prices sampled from upper tail of noisy bid distributions create order-statistic bias, compounding to exponential price growth without requiring optimism assumptions. Six distinct regimes identified (band-stability to runaway bubbles). ML valuation algorithms may inadvertently amplify inherent statistical bias.

**GRAO exp_02 validation:** agent-economics uncovered domain validated — agent-based market dynamics with emergent price escalation.

**Framework relevance score:** 7/10

### [Distributed Zeroth-Order Policy Gradient for Networked Multi-agent RL from Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.15697)
- **arXiv:** 2605.15697
- **Authors:** Pengcheng Dai, He Wang, Dongming Wang, Jian Qin, Wenwu Yu
- **Published:** 2026-05-15
- **Relevance:** GRAO (learning_acceleration, exp_06 validation) + GNW (drive competition)

**Why it matters:** Distributed zeroth-order policy gradient for networked multi-agent RL with human feedback. Fully distributed — feedback depends solely on κ-hop neighborhood state-action information, no centralized control. Converges to ε-stationary point with polynomial sample complexity. Spatiotemporally truncated trajectories as human preference mechanism. Simulation results in GridWorld and predator-prey environments.

**GRAO exp_06 validation:** learning_acceleration validated — distributed learning without centralized training. Infrastructure pattern: local neighborhood aggregation → gradient estimation → convergence.

**Framework relevance score:** 8/10

### [Cooperative Transportation: Optimal and Efficient Task Allocation and Path Finding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.16097)
- **arXiv:** 2605.16097
- **Authors:** Nikolai W. F. Bode, Edmund R. Hunt
- **Published:** 2026-05-15
- **Relevance:** Clawstr (harness engineering) + GRAO (benchmarking optimization, exp_03 validation)

**Why it matters:** Formalizes Cooperative Transportation Task Allocation and Path Finding (CT-TAPF) — team formation, task assignment, collision-free pathfinding for multi-agent cooperative transport. Optimal solver (CT-TCBS) with novel Incremental Expansion strategy. Sub-optimal solvers with global task-centric perspective. Key findings: incremental expansion outperforms naive combinatorial approach; task-conflict expansion dilemma identified; sub-optimal solvers establish new efficiency frontier.

**GRAO exp_03 validation:** benchmarking infrastructure validated — CT-TAPF provides new benchmark domain for multi-agent task allocation.

**Framework relevance score:** 6/10

### [From Gridworlds to Warehouses: Adapting Lightweight One-shot MAPF for AGVs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.15799)
- **arXiv:** 2605.15799
- **Authors:** Hiroki Nagai, Keisuke Okumura
- **Published:** 2026-05-15
- **Relevance:** Clawstr (harness engineering) + GRAO (trace_collection)

**Why it matters:** Multi-agent warehouse pathfinding (MAWPF) tailored to differential-drive AGVs — four constraints: straight motion + in-place rotation, multi-step rotation costs, acceleration/deceleration, follower collision prohibition. Adapts PP, LNS2, PIBT, LaCAM algorithms. PIBT-based approaches achieve preferable scalability.

**Framework relevance score:** 5/10
